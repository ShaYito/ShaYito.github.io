Continuum Theory(MPM course-2016-Jiang) Continuum assumption can be made for almost all solids and liquids, including deformable (elastic and plastic)objects, muscle, flesh, cloth, hair, liquid, smoke, gas, granular materials (sand, snow, mud, soil, etc.). A continuum body defines quantities such as density, velocity and force as continuous functions of position. The main focus of continuum kinematics/motion is the deformation, either locally or globally in different coordinate systems of interests. Luckily in most cases, we can describe kinematics without introducing the meaning of force, stress or even mass.","link":"/2021/12/06/Material-Point-Method-MPM/"},{"title":"NeRF","text":"NeRF: Representing Scenes as Neural Radiance Fields for View SynthesisNeRF repository contributionsneural radiance fieldsnetwork or ，where only relies on . volume renderingcolor , where transmittance , ray . radiance field: the color radiating from point in direction . stratified sampling for integral estimation evenly partition into bins, then sample uniformly at random in each bin. color , where , . 注意：采样后变成了（用到了exp(x)-&gt;x+1(x-&gt;0)的近似）；在表达式中，采样值乘区间长度代替了积分。 问题：这里能用Monte-Carol估计积分吗?","link":"/2021/11/30/NeRF/"},{"title":"Implicit Geometric Regularization","text":"I looked into the paper ‘Implicit Geometric Regularization for Learning Shapes’ and did a presentation on it.","link":"/2021/12/11/Implicit-Geometric-Regularization/"},{"title":"cloth simulation","text":"Method 1: Newton’s Method + Jacobi Method with Chebyshev AccelerationNewton’s method is also called backward Euler or implicit Euler Method 2: Position Based Dynamics + a Jacobi ApproachTo avoid bias of Gauss-Seidel Approach, we adopt Jacobi Approach. ppt courtesy to Huamin Wang’s GAMES103 course","link":"/2021/12/12/cloth-simulation/"},{"title":"Volume_Rendering","text":"my Thoughtsvolume rendering 优点：统一 transparent 和 opaque 物体的渲染方法，如毛发、烟雾等； 缺点：计算量远大于surface rendering；存储量大？ 通过opacity来确认occlusion in NeRF-2020color , where transmittance , ray . radiance field 指 stratified sampling for integral estimation: do random uniform sample in each even partition . 即 , is the number of partitions. color , where , . 注：采样后换成了，利用； 注：在表达式中，采样值区间长度之积代替了积分。 in Volume Rendering of Neural Implicit Surfaces-2021-Yarivpaper page “In essence, volume rendering is all about approximating the integrated light radiance along this ray reaching the camera.” “体渲染的本质：估计积分” transparency (same as NeRF) opacity , , , and it is monotonic increasing. weight is a PDF (Probability Density Function) color , where is radiance field 注：这里的 相当于NeRF里的 ，只是增加了对边界法向量 的依赖。 “NeRF is heavily affected by the sampled point during intensity calculation.” 采样方法的问题： NeRF的 “random uniform sample“ 会造成 artifacts； 若改成 “fixed uniform sample” 会造成另一种 artifacts； in Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images-2019-Lombardipaper page （*本文最早把volume rendering用于novel view synthesis） from Section 6.1 Semi-Transparent Volume Rendering “If the accumulated opacity reaches 1 (for example, when the ray traverses an opaque region), then no further color can be accumulated on the ray”","link":"/2021/11/29/Volume-Rendering/"},{"title":"collision simulation","text":"MethodElasticity Skinning-2011-McAdams Technical notes on equations of corotational elasticity","link":"/2021/12/07/collision-simulation/"},{"title":"linear solver","text":"Problem SolversJacobi/Gauss-Seidel iteration Conjugate gradientscourtesy to Huamin Wang’s GAMES103 course and Yuanming Hu’s GAMES201 course","link":"/2021/12/13/linear-solver/"},{"title":"rigid body collision","text":"Method: Shape Matching Basic Idea: first handle collision and friction of vertices independetnly, then enforce constraint to restore regidity.
