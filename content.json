Continuum Theory(MPM course-2016-Jiang) Continuum assumption can be made for almost all solids and liquids, including deformable (elastic and plastic)objects, muscle, flesh, cloth, hair, liquid, smoke, gas, granular materials (sand, snow, mud, soil, etc.). A continuum body defines quantities such as density, velocity and force as continuous functions of position. The main focus of continuum kinematics/motion is the deformation, either locally or globally in different coordinate systems of interests. Luckily in most cases, we can describe kinematics without introducing the meaning of force, stress or even mass.","link":"/2021/12/06/Material-Point-Method-MPM/"},{"title":"Volume_Rendering","text":"my Thoughtsvolume rendering 优点：统一 transparent 和 opaque 物体的渲染方法，如毛发、烟雾等； 缺点：计算量远大于surface rendering；存储量大？ 通过opacity来确认occlusion in NeRF-2020color , where transmittance , ray . radiance field 指 stratified sampling for integral estimation: do random uniform sample in each even partition . 即 , is the number of partitions. color , where , . 注：采样后换成了，利用； 注：在表达式中，采样值区间长度之积代替了积分。 in Volume Rendering of Neural Implicit Surfaces-2021-Yarivpaper page “In essence, volume rendering is all about approximating the integrated light radiance along this ray reaching the camera.” “体渲染的本质：估计积分” transparency (same as NeRF) opacity , , , and it is monotonic increasing. weight is a PDF (Probability Density Function) color , where is radiance field 注：这里的 相当于NeRF里的 ，只是增加了对边界法向量 的依赖。 “NeRF is heavily affected by the sampled point during intensity calculation.” 采样方法的问题： NeRF的 “random uniform sample“ 会造成 artifacts； 若改成 “fixed uniform sample” 会造成另一种 artifacts； in Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images-2019-Lombardipaper page （*本文最早把volume rendering用于novel view synthesis） from Section 6.1 Semi-Transparent Volume Rendering “If the accumulated opacity reaches 1 (for example, when the ray traverses an opaque region), then no further color can be accumulated on the ray”","link":"/2021/11/29/Volume-Rendering/"},{"title":"approaches & methods","text":"Descent MethodsGradient Descent: .

Advantages: Easy to implement and compatible with other nodal systems, i.e., cloth and soft bodies. Disadvantages: Difficult to strictly enforce friction and other goals. (The rigidification process will destroy them.) Suggestion: More suitable when the friction accuracy is less important, i.e., buttons on clothes.
