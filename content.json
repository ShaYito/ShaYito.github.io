Continuum Theory (MPM course-2016-Jiang) Continuum assumption can be made for almost all solids and liquids, including deformable (elastic and plastic)objects, muscle, flesh, cloth, hair, liquid, smoke, gas, granular materials (sand, snow, mud, soil, etc.). A continuum body defines quantities such as density, velocity and force as continuous functions of position. The main focus of continuum kinematics/motion is the deformation, either locally or globally in different coordinate systems of interests. Luckily in most cases, we can describe kinematics without introducing the meaning of force, stress or even mass.","link":"/2021/12/06/Material-Point-Method-MPM/"},{"title":"Implicit Geometric Regularization","text":"I looked into the paper 'Implicit Geometric Regularization for Learning Shapes' and did a presentation on it.","link":"/2021/12/11/Implicit-Geometric-Regularization/"},{"title":"Volume_Rendering","text":"my Thoughts volume rendering 优点：统一 transparent 和 opaque 物体的渲染方法，如毛发、烟雾等； 缺点：计算量远大于surface rendering；存储量大？ 通过opacity来确认occlusion in NeRF-2020 color , where transmittance , ray . radiance field 指 stratified sampling for integral estimation: do random uniform sample in each even partition . 即 , is the number of partitions. color , where , . 注：采样后换成了，利用； 注：在表达式中，采样值区间长度之积代替了积分。 in Volume Rendering of Neural Implicit Surfaces-2021-Yariv paper page \"In essence, volume rendering is all about approximating the integrated light radiance along this ray reaching the camera.\" \"体渲染的本质：估计积分\" transparency (same as NeRF) opacity , , , and it is monotonic increasing. weight is a PDF (Probability Density Function) color , where is radiance field 注：这里的 相当于NeRF里的 ，只是增加了对边界法向量 的依赖。 \"NeRF is heavily affected by the sampled point during intensity calculation.\" 采样方法的问题： NeRF的 \"random uniform sample\" 会造成 artifacts； 若改成 \"fixed uniform sample\" 会造成另一种 artifacts； in Neural Volumes: Learning Dynamic Renderable Volumes from Images-2019-Lombardi paper page （*本文最早把volume rendering用于novel view synthesis） from Section 6.1 Semi-Transparent Volume Rendering \"If the accumulated opacity reaches 1 (for example, when the ray traverses an opaque region), then no further color can be accumulated on the ray\"","link":"/2021/11/29/Volume-Rendering/"},{"title":"elastic simulation","text":"learing notes of SIGGRAPH 2012 Course \"FEM Simulation of 3D Deformable Solids: A practitioner's guide to theory, discretization and model reduction\" Deformation undeformed/reference configuration deformed configuration deformation map deformation gradiant or ( is the Jacobian matrix of ) Strain &amp; Hyperelasticity strain energy note: for hyperelastic materials, only depends on (or the initial and final configurations and ) and not on the deformation path over time (or equivalently, the elastic forces of hyperelastic materials are conservative). energy density measures the strain energy per unit undeformed volume on an infinitesiml domain around the mateiral point using first-order Taylor expansion thus, is a function of alone, i.e. .
